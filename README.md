# 🚨 CrisisConnect — AI-Powered Disaster Response Coordination

CrisisConnect is a **serverless AI system** that connects **disaster incidents** with the **right NGOs and resources** in real time.  
It leverages **Google AI Studio**, **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, and **Cloud Run** to orchestrate an intelligent, multi-agent response network.

---

## 🌍 Inspiration

During emergencies, critical time is lost because information from the field is unstructured, delayed, or poorly routed.  
We built CrisisConnect to act as a **real-time coordination hub**, turning fragmented crisis data into actionable insight — all powered by scalable, serverless AI infrastructure.

---

## 💡 What It Does

CrisisConnect deploys a set of cooperating agents that handle data ingestion, matching, summarization, and reporting.

| Agent / Job | Role |
|--------------|------|
| 🛰️ **DataScoutAgent** | Collects and preprocesses real-world crisis data (incident reports, NGO updates, resource availability) and stores it in Firestore. |
| 🧭 **ResourcePlannerAgent** | Analyzes new incidents and matches each reported need (e.g., “medical aid”, “water supply”) with NGOs capable of responding. |
| 🧠 **CrisisSummarizerAgent** | Uses Gemini models to summarize ongoing crises, identify emerging trends, and generate concise daily situation briefs. |
| 📊 **ReportWriter** | A background Cloud Run job that aggregates daily incident and NGO activity into structured CSV or JSON reports for analytics dashboards. |

A **web dashboard** (built via AI Studio) visualizes active incidents, matches, summaries, and performance metrics for field coordinators.

## 🏗️ How We Built It

1. **AI Studio**
   - Generated initial agent scaffolds for `DataScoutAgent`, `ResourcePlannerAgent`, and `CrisisSummarizerAgent`.
   - Used the *Deploy to Run* workflow to push directly to Cloud Run.

2. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**
   - Implemented agents as subclasses of `adk.Agent`.
   - Defined structured `plan()` and `act()` methods for coordination.
   - Connected to Firestore for persistence.

3. **Google Cloud Run**
   - Each agent and the background job runs as an independent containerized service:
     - `datascout`
     - `resourceplanner`
     - `crisissummarizer`
     - `reportwriter`
     - `dashboard`

4. **Firestore**
   - Collections: `incidents`, `ngos`, `matches`, `summaries`.

5. **Cloud Storage + Pub/Sub**
   - Handles asynchronous triggers and data ingestion pipelines.

6. **Cloud Build + Artifact Registry**
   - Automates build and deployment via CI/CD.


## 🧪 API Usage (cURL Commands)

 1. **Ingest Sample Crisis Reports**
    - Adds structured crisis text data into Firestore through **DataScoutAgent**.
```bash
   curl -X POST "$DATASCOUT_URL/invoke/ingest_from_feed" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "items": [
             "Severe flooding has hit the city of Austin, hundreds displaced and in need of food and shelter.",
             "Wildfires near Denver are spreading rapidly, urgent need for medical supplies and volunteer firefighters."
           ]
         }' | jq .
```
 2. **Summarize a Single Crisis Text**
    - Summarizes any given crisis report using Gemini via **DataScoutAgent**.
```bash
   curl -X POST "$DATASCOUT_URL/invoke/summarize_text" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "text": "Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in Austin; hundreds need shelter and food assistance."
         }' | jq .
```

 3. **Fetch and Ingest Real-World Feeds**
    - Pulls live disaster data (e.g., ReliefWeb, APIs) and updates Firestore.
```bash
   curl -X POST "$DATASCOUT_URL/invoke/fetch_and_ingest" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
```
 
 4. **Plan and Match Unresolved Incidents**
    - Runs ResourcePlannerAgent to match incidents with NGOs in Firestore.
```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$RESOURCEPLANNER_URL/invoke/plan_unmatched_incidents" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"limit": 50}' | jq .
```

 5. **Execute the ReportWriter Job**
    - Triggers the background job to generate analytics and summary reports (can run only when you have access to the project).
```bash
   gcloud run jobs execute reportwriter --region "$REGION"
```

 6. **Generate a Crisis Summary Report**
    - Produces summarized overviews from multiple crisis incidents.
```bash
   cat > sample_request.json <<'JSON'
   {
     "reports": [
       {"location": "Denver, CO", "type": "Wildfire", "severity": 4, "status": "Active", "needs": "Medical supplies"},
       {"location": "Minneapolis, MN", "type": "Flood", "severity": 3, "status": "Stabilizing", "needs": "Food and shelter"}
     ]
   }
   JSON
   
   curl -s -X POST "$CRISIS_URL/summarize" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @sample_request.json

```

 7. **Retrieve Latest Summary**
    - Fetches the most recent summary generated by CrisisSummarizerAgent.
```bash
   curl -s "$CRISIS_URL/summarize_latest"
```

 8. **Plan Limited Incident Set**
    - Runs matching for a small subset of incidents (testing mode).
```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$URL/invoke/plan_unmatched_incidents" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"limit": 5}' | jq .
```
